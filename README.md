# Label My Items

A basic mod that adds the Item Label and the Eraser, which are used together to manage item labels.

Item labels appear in the tooltip of an item.

To create a label, get an Item Label and right-click on it with a Name Tag. The created label will reflect the custom name of the Name Tag.
